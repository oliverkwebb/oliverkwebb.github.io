I am at the time of writing (January 2025) 16 and a high school student.
And have been programming and learning about how computers work for a
couple years. I know how to work C, Lua, Bash, and Linux, extensively.

I have a page describing the software I use [here](/rocks)

## Projects I've made

- [cheat](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/cheat): An offline analog for [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
- [moontool](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/moontool): A collection of C programs that work with moon phases
- [ytmpv](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/ytmpv): A shell script that provides quick access to proxies to counter anti-ad-block
- [calfact](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/calfact) A xkcd 1930 generator
- [pdlibc](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/pdlibc): A public domain example implementation of libc aiming to be a superset of nolibc and compliment with C89
- [luaed](https://codeberg.org/oliverkwebb/luaed): An ed implementation with syntax highlighting
- [newtime](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/newtime): A redesign of the C time library with an emphasis on cleanliness and completeness.

## Other projects I've contributed significantly to

- [toybox](https://www.landley.net/toybox): Over 200 Linux command line utilities in a single (500KB) executable

I've implemented a couple of commands to toybox, did cleanup work on the xz
decompresser, `getopt`, and the bc implementation. Added the 'g' and 'd'
commands to it's vi. Among other things, such as `tr -t`.

- [wak](https://www.github.com/raygard/wak): POSIX compliment Awk implementation in 4500 Lines of C, used in toybox.

I've added boolean operator functions (e.g. `and()`, `or()`, `xor()`, `lshift()`, and `rshift()`) and [UTF8 handling support](/articles/utfawk)

- [libtime](https://gitlab.com/libtime/documentation/-/wikis/home): Time API and implementation documentation
