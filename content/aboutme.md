I am at the time of writing (August 2024) 15 and a high school student.
And have been programming and learning about how computers work for a
couple years. I know how to work C, Lua, Bash, and Linux, extensively.

Projects I've made:

- [cheat](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/cheat): An offline analog for [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
- [moontool](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/moontool): A collection of C programs that work with moon phases
- [ytmpv](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/ytmpv): A shell script that provides quick accses to proxies to counter anti-ad-block

Other projects I've contributed significantly to:

- [toybox](https://www.landley.net/toybox): Over 200 Linux command line utilities in a single (500KB) executable

I've implemented a couple of commands to toybox, did cleanup work on the xz
decompressor, `getopt`, and the bc implementation. Added the 'g' and 'd'
commands to it's vi. Among other things, such as `tr -t`.

- [wak](https://www.github.com/raygard/wak): POSIX compliment Awk implementation in 4500 Lines of C, used in toybox.

I've added boolean operator functions (e.g. `and()`, `or()`, `xor()`, `lshift()`,
and `rshift()`) and [UTF8 handling support](/articles/utfawk)
