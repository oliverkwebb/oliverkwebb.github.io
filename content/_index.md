Welcome! To my Website.

I'll probably only post here if I find something interesting or motivating
enough to share or write about.

I'm a programmer, and I usually have better stuff
to do then write in my free time. So some articles might just be adapted from
emails I wrote engaging in technical discussion.

If you want to know more about who I _am_, see the [about me](/aboutme/)
page.
