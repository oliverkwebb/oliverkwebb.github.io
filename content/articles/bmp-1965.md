On July 14th, 1965, the [Mariner 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4) spacecraft flew by Mars, the first
to ever reach the planet successfully. In the scientific data it recorded, it took 21 pictures, similar space
probes built for the moon or earth would usually transmit image data back in a analog format of continuous
scan-lines (similar to a TV broadcast). But for clarity across interplanetary distances, This probe had
to record and transmit its data back in a digital format.

# .bmp-1965

Image data from this was transmitted back as a series of bits, with a 6 bit number per pixel.
Weirdly enough, the highest number (63, 0b111111) represented black whilst 0 represented white,
the opposite of how its represented today.

These pixels would be transmitted continuously to send a 200x200 image.

# Digitializing this format

From here, these pixels would be recorded as dots on a tape, this tape would
be scanned to imprint the image onto film, and finer restoration work would
be done to perfect the picture. This is an example of an early dot-matrix
image printer.

Now, with modern computers and image formats, this data format does not
have to be imprinted onto tape to be viewed, converting this to raw
RGB data is fairly easy, and from there, you can convert that to
png/jpg/etc using tools like XPM or [farbfeld](https://tools.suckless.org/farbfeld/)
(which is just 16-bit ARGB). The only hard part of this process is
that Mariner 4 image data works with 6 bit pixels, which means that
you have to work with chunks of 4 pixels (3 bytes) at a time.

Doing bit the manipulation needed to pack the image data efficiently,
any 200x200 image can be converted and viewed as if it came from the
antenna of a 1960's space probe.
