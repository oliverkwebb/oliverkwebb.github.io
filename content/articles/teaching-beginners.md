It is a well known fact that every expert at every skill was once only a mere beginner.
This of course includes you and your peers. And now, someone ambitious has come to you,
asking for guidance on their journey.

It is as important in this moment as it is in the rest of the process to boast your own
ego because of this, and to think about how your skills are certified by this very
interaction. Think about yourself, and how noble you'd have to be for a person to
come to you for advice[^1].

[^1]: This is especially important in unscheduled interactions, such as IRC channels.

The only question now is where do we start? What processes do we use? How do we make
sure whoever has came to us stays interested? This guide will teach you that and more.

# The more unfamiliar, the more direct

For most things: As you learn, the model of what you are doing will grow [simpler](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/).
Sharp edges will be worn down and your idea of what is going on will be reduced to a set of axioms.
This model is held internally, and is shaped by your experience and prior learning.

Therefore, if you lay out your internal model of how something works to them, they will immediately
gain the same skill level as you

# The more familiar, the more indirect

If the thing you are teaching is a subcategory or tool in some other field. The person asking you for advice
will probably already have an okay-ish model of that field in their mind. In this case, *mysticism is your friend*!

# Don't explain

# Don't provide examples
