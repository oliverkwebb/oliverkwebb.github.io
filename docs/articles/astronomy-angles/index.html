<p>The time of day as an idea needs no introduction.</p>
<div style="width: 100%" id="current-time">
</div>
<script src="/trinkets/current-time.js"></script>

<p>But what does it <em>represent</em>, really? Well, it represents a fraction of a rotation (the Earth&rsquo;s), which makes it an Angle.</p>
<p>In many astronomical calculations, angles are represented as time to make certain conversions easier. For example,
the horizontal coordinate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol">Algol</a> is 03:08:10.13 (Usually written 03h08m10.13s).</p>
<p>If you disregard the fact that this is a coordinate and treat it as a time of day,
you can convert this time to your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">local mean siderial time</a>, and get
the hour angle (also written as a time), which its location on the celestial equator relative to you, or rather,
how much the celestial sphere has rotated in comparison to the prime meridian.</p>
<p>Since in astronomy, angles are sometimes represented as time, why not represent time as an angle?</p>

  The 360 hour clock, the 2π hour clock, and the 1 hour clock<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>

<p>In 4 minutes, the earth rotates 1 degree around its axis, and in about 4 hours, it rotates one radian.
This is useful since it can give a vague idea of how much objects will move in the sky. The sun takes
up about half a degree of view in the sky, so a sunset will take a minimum of two minutes.</p>
<p><img src="/graph/AngleTime.png" alt="Conversion between angle units and time units"></p>
<p>Venus takes up about 1/60th of a degree of view. So it could only take 4 seconds to move its own
diameter in the sky, which is good to know for telescope readjustment (&ldquo;If I leave my telescope alone,
I&rsquo;ll be able to see X for at least Y amount of time&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Using degrees in place of hours on a clock, or using &ldquo;turns&rdquo; (the fraction of the day) gives
results that are interesting, but don&rsquo;t deserve much cometary.</p>

  The Tangent of Time
</h1><p>Why radians? To take trig functions, of course!</p>
<div style="width: 100%" id="tangent-of-time">
</div>
<script src="/trinkets/tangent-of-time.js"></script>

<p>Whilst taking trig functions on your coordinates can yield interesting results
(the cosine of your latitude is how long your line of latitude is, compared to the equator).
These don&rsquo;t seem to map to anything interesting and non-obvious.</p>
