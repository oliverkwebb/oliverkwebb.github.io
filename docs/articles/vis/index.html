<article>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been unhappy with neovim and it&rsquo;s bloat. vi is a simple and beautiful tool by
itself, but it&rsquo;s most popular deviation vim has been bloated to the point of being unmanageable
the same way perl took the design of awk or C++ took the design of C and destroyed it.</p>
<p>Neovim remedies this, but not by much. And in place it adds more bloat. And it&rsquo;s decision
on removing build configuration means that it can&rsquo;t be de-bloated in the spirit of tiny vim
builds.</p>
<p>And the worst part of this, some of the bloat is actually useful. Bloated software has the
problem of &ldquo;Everyone only uses 20%, but it&rsquo;s always a different 20%&rdquo;. This makes the minimal
vi implementations hard to use. I <em>want</em> syntax highlighting and colorization, I <em>want</em> the
ability to batch process data with ex commands.  I <em>want</em> the ability to select things with
visual mode. This disqualifies implementations like nextvi, nvi, and busybox vi.</p>
<p>What does this leave? There is apparently one editor called <a href="https://github.com/martanne/vis">vis</a>
that&rsquo;s minimal, has a large amount of vim-isms, and is written in pure C with configuration able to
be done in lua. It only takes up a couple megabytes of space, while vim takes up 60 and neovim takes
up 40. It lacks things like the s, g, and v ex commands in favor of multi-cursor editing.</p>
<p>vis also has inbuilt syntax highlighting, with a <a href="https://github.com/martanne/vis/wiki/Themes">selection of themes to use</a>.
vis has inbuilt options for line numbering (including relative line numbering), tab to space conversion
And autoindenting (Although, Not very good autoindenting). It also has a semi-customize-able
status and keybindings bar via the lua API.</p>
<p>Here are some features that aren&rsquo;t in vis <em>by default</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;gf&rdquo; motion</li>
<li>Leading whitespace detection</li>
<li>Some way to spellcheck/auto-complete</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at these individually and see what vis can achieve.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/martanne/vis/wiki/Plugins">a lot of plugins</a> to do these things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://repo.or.cz/vis-goto-file.git">vis-goto-file</a>: for the &ldquo;gf&rdquo; motion,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erf/vis-highlight">vis-highlight</a>: for leading white-space detection.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/muhq/vis-spellcheck">vis-spellcheck</a>: for spellchecking.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also lua plugins I didn&rsquo;t even know I wanted until now, like the ability to auto-format
and edit markdown tables with <a href="https://www.thyssentishman.com/git/vis-tables/log.html">vis-tables</a>.
And backups that are stored in a reasonable place with <a href="https://github.com/roguh/vis-backup">vis-backup</a>.</p>
<p>That is not to say, vis is not without problems. For example, it is convenient to have the
cursor show up as a bar on insert mode, but show as a block on normal mode, so that you can
tell what mode you are in without looking at the status bar. This would normally be a simple
print statement on changing of modes. But for whatever reason (I think due to the fact that
there is multiple cursor support in vis). This does not change anything.</p>
<p>If you do not like how bloated and large vim and it&rsquo;s forks are. But find the features that
vim provides useful, Vis includes many but not all vim-isms while still being elegant and
versatile.</p>
