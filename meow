## Do we _really_ need custom date string handling functions

The alternative I provide in my time library is `readdate()`, reading time with a configurable set of base
presumptions (i.e. "the year is 2024") is too valuable not to pass up. For this reason, `readdate()` takes
a base date argument, converts it to a calendar, then changes values in that, before converting it back into a date and returning it.

This has multiple benefits over `strptime()`, the first one is that you are consciously choosing what date to base
