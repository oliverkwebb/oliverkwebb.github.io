<title>Writing a UTF-8 safe AWK</title>
<h1>Writing a UTF-8 safe AWK</h1>
<span class="subheading">April 26, 2024</span>
<p>One of the things the toybox project prioritizes is unicode handling for it's
applications. This has kept things like <a href="http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2023-October/029845.html">the fully GNU compatible tr</a>
from being promoted from the pending/ directory for years because they
wish to break compatibility by making tr unicode safe. Toybox's plans for awk
are <a href="http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2021-June/012453.html">no different story</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for any <a href="https://www.github.com/raygard/wak">awk implementation</a>
attempting to get into toybox; Awk works with strings, while tr works with
characters. Awk does not regularly index into the strings it works with, and
when it does it only happens in a few functions. This means that if we want
to handle UTF-8, we can divide and conquer.</p>
<h3 id="what-a-utf-8-safe-awk-needs">What a UTF-8 Safe awk needs</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gawk.1.html">gawk(1) man page</a> says
these 4 functions work on "characters, not bytes":</p>
<ul>
<li>substr()</li>
<li>length()</li>
<li>match()</li>
<li>index()</li>
</ul>
<p>The second addition awk book also mentions these:</p>
<ul>
<li>printf %c [STRING]</li>
<li>printf %c [CODEPOINT]</li>
<li>\u[CODEPOINT]</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, these work internally by indexing the string:</p>
<ul>
<li>toupper()</li>
<li>tolower()</li>
</ul>
<p>That's "divide" out of the way, now lets conquer.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-a-utf-8-awk">Implementing a UTF-8 Awk</h3>
<p>A reminder that we are trying to add in UTF-8 support to a existing awk, not
make a new one with UTF-8 support.</p>
<p>In a awk that is UTF-8 safe, all strings are indexed by a number of UTF-8
characters. While in C, all strings are indexed based off of bytes. This
means that for substr(), length(), match(), and index(). We need a way to
convert between the two. This can be done by two functions, one which counts
the bytes in a utf8 string, and another that counts the characters in a C byte
string. This work was <a href="https://github.com/raygard/wak/commit/2e94cd3de8fb4d091ca19bb429cb4b2cb9d6a80e">originally done by me</a>
with 2 functions that acted as analogs to <code>mbrtowc()</code> and <code>wcstombs()</code> from libc.
And <a href="https://github.com/raygard/wak/commit/2e94cd3de8fb4d091ca19bb429cb4b2cb9d6a80e">Ray Gardner de-over-engineered</a> these functions.</p>
<p>As long as you have the ability to turn unicode codepoints back into strings,
\u[CODEPOINT] is a easy fix too. While the current digit you are reading is a
valid hexidecimal character, read that digit into a buffer. Then <code>strtol()</code> to
turn that buffer into a codepoint, then convert that codepoint back into a string.
There are printf format escapes that print 1 utf8 character of a string.
Which in practice makes printf %c easier. The tolower() and toupper()
problem is more complex, but fundamentally involves taking a string, running
though it and running <code>towlower/upper()</code> on it, expanding it when needed.
You can look at <a href="https://github.com/raygard/wak/commit/2e94cd3de8fb4d091ca19bb429cb4b2cb9d6a80e">the actual code which does this</a>,
as that will explain it better than I could.</p>
<p>FS/split() say that if the field separator is more than one character, it will be
treated as a regex. This in practice does not matter, since a multi-byte unicode
FS will never contain any special regexp syntax character.</p>
<p>Writing in UTF-8 support into a already existing awk is a lot simpler than it seems.
wak needed less than 100 lines to make itself UTF-8 safe. Most of the hard part
is figuring out <em>what</em> needs unicode handling.</p>
