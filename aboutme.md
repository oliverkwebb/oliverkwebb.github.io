## About Me
Heya, If what you wanted is contact information, here is some:

I am at the time of writing (August 2024) 15 and a high school student.
And have been programming and learning about how computers work for a
couple years.

My main area of interest is Linux development, which I've been doing for
well over a year at this point. I work on my own scripts to automate things
occasionally. Here's a list of the most notable scripts I've made:

- [cheat](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/cheat): An offline analog for [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
- [moontool](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/moontool): A collection of
tools adapted from older 80's tools that work with moon phases.
- [ytmpv](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/ytmpv): A dmenu script that provides
quick accses to proxies when youtube is being ~~hostile~~ "unreliable" with
ad-blockers.
- [This website and it's content](https://github.com/oliverkwebb/oliverkwebb.github.io):
A basic SSG made in makefile web content in markdown. With other scripts like a RSS
feed generator.

I have also contributed a fair ammount of code to the [toybox project](https://www.landley.net/toybox).
I've implemented a couple of (fairly minor) commands, did cleanup work
on like the xz decompressor and the bc implementation. Among many other
things. Like UTF-8 support in a [awk implementation](https://www.github.com/raygard)
meant for toybox.
